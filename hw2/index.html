		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
<b>de Casteljau Algorithm Introduction：</b><br/>
de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive linear interpolation method for calculating the Bezier curve point at any parameter t. For a set of control points, linearly interpolate adjacent points to generate a new set of points, repeat until only one point remains, which is the value of the curve at t.
</p>
<p>
<b>My Implementation：</b><br/>
In the <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep</code> function, I traverse all adjacent point pairs, calculate their linear interpolation at t, generate a new set of points, and return. Each call only does one layer of interpolation, and the recursive call can finally obtain the curve point.
</p>
<p>
<b>Screenshot：</b><br/>
Below shows the intermediate and final points of a custom 6-point Bezier curve at different recursive levels.<br/>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>
<b>de Casteljau algorithm extension to Bezier surfaces：</b><br/>
de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces in a elegant way. Bezier surfaces are defined by a control point grid (usually 4×4), we can calculate the surface point at parameter (u,v) by applying the 1D de Casteljau algorithm twice:
</p>

<p>
<b>Separable 1D de Casteljau：</b><br/>
1. First, apply the 1D de Casteljau algorithm to each row of the control point grid (in u direction), get a column of intermediate points.<br/>
2. Then, apply the 1D de Casteljau algorithm to this column of intermediate points (in v direction), get the final surface point.
</p>

<p>
<b>Implementation details：</b><br/>
I implemented three key functions:
</p>

<p>
1. <code>evaluateStep</code>：Linear interpolation of adjacent points at parameter t.<br/>
<pre>
std::vector<Vector3D> BezierPatch::evaluateStep(std::vector<Vector3D> const &points, double t) const
{
  std::vector<Vector3D> result;
  for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < points.size(); ++i) {
    Vector3D p = (1 - t) * points[i] + t * points[i + 1];
    result.push_back(p);
  }
  return result;
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
2. <code>evaluate1D</code>：Recursively apply evaluateStep until only one point remains, implement the complete 1D de Casteljau algorithm.<br/>
<pre>
Vector3D BezierPatch::evaluate1D(std::vector<Vector3D> const &points, double t) const
{
  std::vector<Vector3D> temp = points;
  while (temp.size() > 1) {
    temp = evaluateStep(temp, t);
  }
  return temp[0];
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
3. <code>evaluate</code>：Implement the separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm, first evaluate each row in u direction, then evaluate the column of points in v direction.<br/>
<pre>
Vector3D BezierPatch::evaluate(double u, double v) const 
{  
  // First, interpolate each row in u direction, get a column of points
  std::vector<Vector3D> u_points;
  for (const auto& row : controlPoints) {
    u_points.push_back(evaluate1D(row, u));
  }
  // Then, interpolate this column of points, get the final point
  return evaluate1D(u_points, v);
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>Advantages of separable 1D de Casteljau：</b><br/>
- <b>High computational efficiency：</b> For a 4×4 control point grid, this method only requires O(n²) operations, instead of O(n⁴) for direct calculation.<br/>
- <b>Good numerical stability：</b> The algorithm is based on linear interpolation, which is numerically stable.<br/>
- <b>Geometric intuition：</b> Each step has a clear geometric interpretation, making the algorithm easier to understand and implement.
</p>

<p>
By implementing this, I have a deeper understanding of how to efficiently represent and evaluate complex surfaces using parametric equations and recursive algorithms. The separable 1D de Casteljau method elegantly demonstrates how to decompose high-dimensional problems into simpler, more manageable operations.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>

		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part3_beforeQ.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Teapot mesh with default flat shading</figcaption>
			<figcaption>(without vertex normals)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part3_afterQ.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Teapot mesh with Phong shading</figcaption>
			<figcaption>(with vertex normals)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		The goal here is to implement a function that will go through every face that has the given vertex endpoint as one of its three points of the triangle. My first step then in completing <code>Vertex::normal()</code> was initializing a <code>Vector3D</code> to store the accumulation of each face's area-weighted normal vector, along with two iterators (<code>HalfedgeCIter</code>), to store the starting half-edge and also track the current half-edge that the program is on as it iterates through every face and its half-edges.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		Vector3D sumAWN(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
		HalfedgeCIter hCheck = this->halfedge(); 
		HalfedgeCIter origin = hCheck;
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		In order to iterate successfully through each connected face with the vertex, I used a <code>do-while</code> loop, inside which I would gather three vectors (<code>v1, v2, v3</code>) to go through each triangle and obtain their <code>Vector3D</code> positions.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		Vector3D v1 = hCheck->vertex()->position;   
		Vector3D v2 = hCheck->next()->vertex()->position; 
		Vector3D v3 = hCheck->next()->next()->vertex()->position;
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		This was crucial in finding the length of two of the triangle's half-edges, represented as two vectors in the 3D space. When applying the cross product of two vectors, it yields a vector perpendicular to the two, such as the right-hand rule — this representing the normal vector of the triangle in this case, while also accounting for the area of the triangle in the same calculation.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		Vector3D n = cross(v2 - v1, v3 - v2);
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		At the end of the loop, all that is left is to store the current face's area-weighted normal vector into <code>sumAWN</code>, position <code>hCheck</code> to the next face, and check if the next face's starting half-edge is the half-edge we initially started in. If not, we continue on with the <code>do-while</code> loop.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		sumAWN += n;  
		hCheck = hCheck->twin()->next();
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		Once the program is back at the original half-edge, the function will return the summed-up value of all faces normalized.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		return sumAWN.unit();
		</code></pre>


		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part4_beforeF.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Teapot mesh before applying edge flips</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part4_afterF.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Teapot mesh after applying edge flips</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		To implement the <code>flipEdge</code> operation, I looked back at relevant slides and the part 4 spec regarding the half-edge connectivity around the two triangles sharing the same edge. This operation would turn the triangle pair (a, b, c) and (c, b, d) with a shared edge (b, c) into triangles (a, d, c) and (a, b, d) by flipping the shared edge (b, c).
		</p>

		<p>
		The first step is to gather all relevant mesh elements: the six half-edges, four vertices, five edges, and two faces that form the local configuration around the shared edge. I then reassign all pointers (next, twin, vertex, edge, and face) using the helper <code>setNeighbors()</code> method.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		HalfedgeIter h_bc = e0->halfedge();
		HalfedgeIter h_ca = h_bc->next();
		HalfedgeIter h_ab = h_ca->next();
		HalfedgeIter h_cb = h_bc->twin();
		HalfedgeIter h_bd = h_cb->next();
		HalfedgeIter h_dc = h_bd->next();
		...

		VertexIter v_a = h_ab->vertex();
		VertexIter v_b = h_bc->vertex();
		...

		EdgeIter e_bc_cb = e0;  // The shared edge to be flipped
		...

		FaceIter f_abc = h_ab->face();
		FaceIter f_bdc = h_dc->face();
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		Given that there are many pointers at play here, esecially when looking ahead at Part 5's <code>edgeSplit</code>, I was advised to create a Half-edge table to assist tracking every iterator proved useful. (Thanks Sanika!) 
		</p>

		<p>
		This table includes both the triangles that will be restructured and the outer surrounding edges and vertices that will remain unchanged. It was important and much easier to track which half-edges point to which vertices, faces, etc., because many of these pointers change during the flip operation. 
		</p>

		<figure style="text-align: center;">

			<figcaption>Halfedge Table</figcaption>
			<figcaption>setNeighbors(next, twin, vertex, edge, face)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		Once everything is identified and labeled, I proceeded with reassigning the pointers for the new triangle pair from the flip operation by using the setNeighbors() function:
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		h_bc->setNeighbors(h_ab, h_cb, v_d, e_bc_cb, f_bdc);
		h_cb->setNeighbors(h_dc, h_bc, v_a, e_bc_cb, f_abc);
		h_ab -> setNeighbors(h_bd, h_ba, v_a, e_ab_ba, f_bdc); 
		... 
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		This involved a lot of tracing and looking back at the table for the Halfedge structure, along with assigning the correct Halfedge pointer to all the vertices, edges, and faces.
		</p>

		<p>
		I ran into an issue regarding my pointers as when I initially flipped some of the edges, a triangle across the operated edge would seem to disappear. I realized either one or a few iterators may have been misplaced in my function, so I went back through the image of my Half-edge table, and after rescanning and retracing each connection, I noticed I had for some reason set the boundary half-edge c->d as the pointer for one of the inner triangle faces, when the correct one was half-edge d->c. 
		</p>


		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>

		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part5_beforeSF.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Mesh before applying edge splits</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="images/part5_afterS.png" style="width:350px;">
			<figcaption>Mesh after applying edge splits</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		To implement the <code>splitEdge</code> operation, I started by identifying and labeling all original half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces surrounding the edge to be split. Then, I created six new half-edges to form the inner connections to and from the midpoint, as well as three new edges and two new faces. A new midpoint vertex <code>m</code> is created with position set to the average of the two edge endpoints.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		VertexIter v_m = newVertex();  
		v_m->position = ((v_c->position + v_b->position) / 2.0);
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		Then, I used the <code>setNeighbors()</code> helper function to carefully assign the <code>next</code>, <code>twin</code>, <code>vertex</code>, <code>edge</code>, and <code>face</code> fields for all new and updated half-edges. I reassigned the affected pointers for the involved vertices, edges, and faces as well, ensuring consistency and correct orientation.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		h_ab->setNeighbors(h_bm, h_ba, v_a, e_ab_ba, f_abm);
		h_bm->setNeighbors(h_ma, h_mb, v_b, e_mb_bm, f_abm);
		h_ma->setNeighbors(h_ab, h_am, v_m, e_ma_am, f_abm);
		...
		h_md->setNeighbors(h_dc, h_dm, v_m, e_md_dm, f_bdc);
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		Without deleting any elements, I had to make sure that the original half-edge <code>h_bc</code> (which was along the original edge to be split) now pointed as m->c. This ensures that  the new  midpoint vertex has its halfedge pointing along the split edge when returned.
		</p>

		<p>
		Just like in Part 4, I created a Halfedge Table diagram specifically for this function, as it proved helpful to me in carefully tracking all pointers.
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

			<figcaption>Halfedge Table for <code>splitEdge()</code></figcaption>
			<figcaption>setNeighbors(next, twin, vertex, edge, face)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		Once all half-edges and elements were reassigned correctly, my edge splits worked perfectly and could be used with edge flips. Below is an example of performing both operations together.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

		<p>
		To implement <code>upsample()</code> for loop subdivision, I followed the five major steps recommended in the spec and class lectures. The goal is to upscale the "resolution" the mesh by introducing new vertices and faces in each existing triangle, while updating positions using the Loop subdivision rules. 
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<figure style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="images/part6_beforeLoop.png" style="width:350px;">
				<figcaption>Mesh before a Loop subdivision</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="images/part6_afterLoop.png" style="width:350px;">
				<figcaption>Mesh after applying 1 Loop subdivision</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</div>

		<p>
		<b>Step 1:</b> For each <code>original vertex</code>, I calculated its new position using the Loop subdivision weight formula, which depends on its degree <code>n</code>. I marked all existing vertices as <code>isNew = false</code>. Using a <code>do-while</code> loop to iterate around the 1-ring neighbors worked well here.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		if (n == 3) {
		u = 3.0 / 16.0;
		} else {
		u = 3.0 / (8.0 * n);
		}
		v->newPosition = ((1 - n * u) * v->position) + (u * sumNeighbors);
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		<b>Step 2:</b> For each <code>original edge</code>, I computed its <code>newPosition</code> using the weighted average formula: 3/8 of the edge endpoints and 1/8 of the opposing face vertices.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		e->newPosition = ((3.0 / 8.0) * (a + b)) + ((1.0 / 8.0) * (c + d));
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		<b>Step 3:</b> I stored all original edges into a separate vector, then split each of them using my <code>splitEdge()</code> function from Part 5. I marked all newly added vertices as <code>isNew = true</code> and assigned their precomputed <code>newPosition</code>.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		VertexIter v_added = mesh.splitEdge(e);
		v_added->newPosition = e->newPosition;
		v_added->isNew = true;
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		<b>Step 4:</b> I flipped all <code>new edges</code> that connect an old and new vertex. However, I believe I ran into an error here, as half of the flips didn't give the expected result. I suspected that it had to do with one of the isNew() assignments but I couldn't find it.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		if (v1->isNew != v2->isNew) {
		mesh.flipEdge(e);  // Flipping sometimes breaks the mesh
		}
		</code></pre>

		<p>
		<b>Step 5:</b> Finally, I copied <code>newPosition</code> into each vertex's actual <code>position</code>. 
		</p>

		<pre><code>
		v->position = v->newPosition;
		</code></pre>
